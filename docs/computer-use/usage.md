# Computer Use and Browser Use in Pi

**English** | [한국어](usage.ko.md)

Set up Codex Desktop's installed runtime, choose the surfaces Pi may expose, and run app/browser tasks with runtime approval. This package supplies the MCP bridge, not an automation engine or OS sandbox. Computer Use and Browser Use both default to on.

## Before starting

- Use Node.js 22.19 or later and Pi 0.99.1 or later. Recorded live sessions used Pi 0.99.1; later host compatibility is not implied by that record.
- Install Codex Desktop, sign in with a Codex-capable account, and enable its Computer Use plugin once to prepare the runtime configuration. Codex CLI alone is insufficient.
- For native app work on macOS, grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to `Codex Computer Use.app`.
- For Browser Use, run Google Chrome with the ChatGPT Chrome extension enabled and Desktop's Chrome/Browser plugin/native messaging host installed.
- Keep Desktop running. macOS has live verification records; Windows discovery is implemented but actual Windows execution is unverified. Linux is unsupported.

The package does not read Codex credentials or confirm subscription/login eligibility. You must confirm those requirements yourself. Chrome is the only enabled browser backend; `iab`, `mcpapps`, and Edge are unavailable through this bridge.

## 1. Install and load the package

For a published npm release:

```sh
pi install npm:@buyong/pi-codex-computer-use
pi list
pi
```

For the current source checkout, run from the repository root instead:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run build -- --filter=@buyong/pi-codex-computer-use
node_modules/.bin/pi -ne -e ./packages/pi-codex-computer-use/dist/index.js
```

Do not load both paths or overlap with the same extension in `@buyong/pi-codex`. A successfully loaded extension registers `/computer-use` and `/computer-use-check`. Runtime tools appear only when a feature is on and the runtime connects; the footer reports feature/server state.

## 2. Check and resolve prerequisites

In Pi, run:

```text
/computer-use-check
/computer-use status
```

The first command reports requirements and an ordered setup guide. The second reports current switches, runtime source, and server state without full diagnostics. `/computer-use check` is a compatibility alias for the first command.

| Check status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ok` | The stated check passed; not proof of a successful automation task |
| `missing` | A required item was not found or a validation failed; follow the reported action |
| `user-owned` | You must confirm account/login or an OS permission |
| `unverified` | Implementation or environment evidence is incomplete; not a pass |
| `skipped` | The check was not run, for example on a simulated platform |

The check inspects installed files and can run the installed runtime's setup/validation commands. It does not itself install or copy the runtime, repair native-host registration, grant privacy permissions, change feature switches, or operate apps/tabs. Those validation scripts belong to the installed Desktop runtime; update Desktop if they fail.

Resolve requirements in this order: Desktop installation and login, native service/permissions if using Computer Use, Chrome extension/native host if using Browser Use, then rerun the check. You can leave an unused surface off even when its prerequisites are missing.

### Where runtime discovery looks

1. The newest enabled Desktop configuration under `CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/unified-computer-use/<version>/.mcp.json`.
2. On macOS only, the installed app's `cua_node/manifest.json` when no usable plugin cache is found.

`CODEX_HOME` normally is `~/.codex`; Windows also uses the user's profile directory when appropriate. Windows requires a Desktop-written cache entry and has no app-bundle fallback. The bridge does not write discovery results back to Codex settings.

The macOS app-bundle fallback and cold native-service launch remain unverified. `PI_CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_APP_PATH` can select a nonstandard macOS app bundle. A discovered plan or an `ok` file check does not establish that a private runtime will work after a Desktop update.

## 3. Select only the features you need

```text
/computer-use
```

In the single TUI list, use **↑/↓** to select Computer Use or Browser Use and **Enter/Space** to toggle it. Changes save immediately and restart the runtime; the view and selected row remain. Esc closes the view without undoing saved changes.

For Browser Use only:

```text
/computer-use computer off
/computer-use browser on
```

| Switches | Exposed surfaces | Server/tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Both on | `browser,computer` | Shared server; `js` and `js_reset` |
| Computer only | `computer` | Shared server; `js` and `js_reset` |
| Browser only | `browser` | Shared server; `js` and `js_reset` |
| Both off | None | No server; tools hidden |

RPC presents a repeating two-feature picker with Close. Print/JSON mode prints status for the bare command and accepts explicit arguments; it does not render the custom settings screen.

### Settings file

The path is `<agentDir>/codex-computer-use/settings.json`, where `agentDir` honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and defaults to `~/.pi/agent`.

```json
{
  "computerUse": true,
  "browserUse": true
}
```

A missing file uses both defaults without creating a file. An existing file must contain both boolean keys and no unknown keys. Invalid or unreadable settings force both features off for the session; toggle commands refuse to overwrite an invalid file. Fix the file, then reload/restart Pi.

Changing a switch waits for the agent to become idle and restarts the shared server. **The restart clears all REPL variables and app/tab bindings**, including bindings from the other surface. Manual file changes also need reload or restart.

## 4. Run a task and answer approvals

For a first inventory without operations, ask:

```text
Use mcp__cua_repl__js to run await cua.getState(). Summarize the available apps and browsers without operating them.
```

For a bounded browser task, ask:

```text
Use Browser Use to open https://example.com in Chrome, read its accessibility state, and close the tab. Do not submit forms or download anything.
```

The model must follow the runtime documentation returned by the first call. `cua` is already initialized; do not manually import/bootstrap the legacy `@oai/sky` or browser-client flow.

### Entry calls, output, and persistent bindings

- On the first `js` call, or after reset/settings restart, call exactly **one supported entry API**, optionally assigning its result. Do not combine it with other calls, waits, or snapshots. Read the returned documentation/state before continuing.
- For a new page without a requested backend, use `cua.createBrowserTab("chrome", url, { sessionName: "🔎 Task" })`. For an existing tab, use its observed reference through `cua.getTab`; do not invent a tab ID or open a replacement for an ambiguous reference.
- Entry APIs and default `getAXState()` already emit documentation/state. Do not wrap those results in `nodeRepl.write` or `emitImage` again. Use `nodeRepl.write()` for additional values and await `nodeRepl.emitImage()` for additional images. Bare expression values are not printed.
- Reuse established bindings. After reset or server restart, reacquire them. After context compaction, call `await cua.rewriteDocumentation()` before continuing.

The bridge preserves the original runtime description and adds current Pi host guidance to tool declarations. That guidance remains visible with a custom system prompt. It does not rewrite code, retry failures automatically, reset the REPL automatically, or silently substitute an unavailable browser backend.

### What an approval allows

Runtime permission can allow **operating** the selected app/origin, not only reading it. Choose the narrowest persistence you intend:

| Choice | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow** | This request once |
| **Allow for this session** | Remember for the session, if the runtime offers it |
| **Always allow** | Remember for future requests, if offered; this can change runtime-owned permissions |
| **Cancel** | Dismiss the request; non-tool requests can also offer **Deny** |

Not every request offers every choice. The bridge has no second permission store. Permanent grants were not exercised in the recorded live verification.

Ordinary empty-form `js` execution approvals from `node_repl` follow Codex's user-reviewer auto-approval rule when they are not sensitive and need no user input. Supported ordinary form fields use Pi dialogs. Browser sign-in/QR, email OTP, URL-mode requests, and unsupported forms are declined. Guardian automatic review is not implemented, so Guardian-required prechecks can fail.

Print/JSON mode declines requests that require a user interface. RPC clients must answer the UI requests. Approval wait time is not limited to a fixed 30 seconds by the client; the runtime's own execution timeout still applies.

Esc/caller cancellation sends MCP cancellation and dismisses pending approval. **Already-running JavaScript can continue** until completion or the runtime's timeout. It is not an immediate OS-level kill, and a later call may wait behind it.

## 5. Close task-created resources

Ask the model to close tabs it created and confirm `/computer-use status` after changing switches. The bridge sends one `turn_ended` notification after the agent settles: `Stop` normally and `Interrupt` for an abort. A still-running cancelled call can delay that notification.

Closing or reloading Pi stops the bridge's server process tree, not Desktop's own processes. Resetting the REPL discards bindings; do not treat it as proof that task-created tabs were closed.

Long text is middle-truncated according to the discovered runtime output limit. The fallback is 25,000 approximate tokens, calculated as 100,000 bytes. When saving succeeds, the result identifies a full-output file in the system temporary directory with owner-only permissions. Image blocks are forwarded as image content.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime unavailable | Install/update Desktop, enable its plugin once, and inspect `/computer-use status`. For a nonstandard macOS app, set `PI_CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_APP_PATH`. |
| `platform-unsupported` | Use a supported platform. Windows implementation still needs actual-machine verification. |
| Invalid settings | Fix the exact two boolean keys at the reported path; reload/restart. |
| Setup script stops at missing `bin/npm` or `bin/npx` | The recorded Desktop build omitted those launchers. The check reports that script as unverified and separately validates the runtime. Do not install/copy launchers into Desktop based on this message. |
| Chrome prerequisite missing | Follow the report to install/start Chrome, enable its ChatGPT extension, or configure Desktop's Chrome/Browser plugin. The bridge does not repair the native host. |
| `Browser is not available: iab` / `mcpapps` | Use Chrome. The Desktop examples describe unavailable Pi backends. |
| No approval UI in print/JSON | Use interactive Pi or a UI-capable RPC client; the tool error explains why the request was declined. |
| Login/OTP/URL request declined | Complete login through the supported app/browser flow yourself; this bridge cannot handle those elicitation surfaces. |
| Cancelled call delays later calls | Let the runtime finish or reach its timeout; it serializes JavaScript calls. Inspect status if the server exited. |

Logs rotate at 5 MiB at `<agentDir>/codex-computer-use/mcp.log`. Key-based masking can leave page/app content. Review logs before sharing. Private runtime interfaces and telemetry outside Desktop are not guaranteed by this bridge.

## Recorded verification and remaining gaps

The repository records a 2026-10-05 macOS run with `ChatGPT.app` `26.930.31730` and Pi `0.99.1`: app/browser inventories; Finder once/session/cancel/delayed approvals; RPC abort; Chrome `example.com` origin approval, accessibility state, and close; all four switch combinations; image forwarding and truncation.

The same records cover the single-list settings UI in actual Pi TUI and RPC, Chrome host guidance with custom prompts, and the standalone setup-check command. A successful create/read/close follow-up is one observed run, not a measured reduction in overall failure rate. These are historical records, not live checks performed by following this guide.

Still unverified: Windows execution, cold native-service launch from the app-bundle fallback, Desktop-quit operation, permanent **Always allow**, downloads/uploads, full CDP, WebMCP, and Guardian-dependent flows.
