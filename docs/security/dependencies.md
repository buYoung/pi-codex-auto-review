# Dependency security fixes

**English** | [한국어](dependencies.ko.md)

The current source removes `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`, its transitive `node-forge` dependency, and `bundleDependencies`. The distribution does not include `node_modules` and uses the Pi host as a peer dependency. Its only runtime dependency is `@buyong/redact`, the masking engine published from this repository's `packages/redact`. It is pinned to an exact version, has no runtime dependencies of its own, and npm installs it with the extension. This extension does not replace dependencies in an installed Pi host.

## Audit before the 0.1.3 release

For the lockfile dated 2026-10-04, `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` reported zero vulnerabilities. Including development dependencies, `npm audit --audit-level=high` reported six high-severity findings in `release-it 21.0.1`'s transitive `basic-ftp` and `undici` dependencies and their parent paths. These development tools are not included in the distribution archive.

The action proposed by `npm audit fix --force` changes the major version to `release-it 20.2.0`, so it was not applied in this release. Development tool findings remain unresolved and are separate from the passing production dependency audit.

## Remediation record for the earlier sandbox version

The following record predates sandbox removal. At that time, three high-severity audit findings were addressed, with installed versions `node-forge 1.4.1-0` and `brace-expansion 5.0.12` and zero audit findings recorded. It does not describe the current audit of all development dependencies. The original evidence is preserved in the [security handoff](https://github.com/buYoung/pi-codex-auto-review/blob/HEAD/docs/handoffs/auto-review/11-dependency-security.json).

| Item | Applied fix | Release status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node-forge` and its `sandbox-runtime` consumer | Pinned commit `ceba34402e329f0365134f23fe19898756527d65` from the [fix PR](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/pull/1152), which rejects extra RSA `DigestAlgorithm` elements | An **unmerged development version**, not an official fixed release. Compared with 1.4.0, library code changed only in RSA verification. |
| `brace-expansion` | Used official fixed version `5.0.12` | Listed as a fixed version in the [official security advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q2hr-2g5m-vwhr). |

At the time of that record, the [official `node-forge` advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-86w9-cpqp-85rv) listed no fixed release. The version was not arbitrarily increased, and audit findings were not suppressed. The actual patch source was pinned and checked with valid PKCS#1 and PSS signatures and malformed signatures rejected by the native crypto module.

## Pi package lock adjustment

Pi 0.99.1's published `npm-shrinkwrap.json` pins `brace-expansion 5.0.9`. Earlier remediation used a repackaged development archive because the installation paths checked at that time did not retain the root override. That workaround was included through 0.1.4.

The current source uses **official `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.99.1` directly**, with its registry integrity recorded in `package-lock.json`. The root override and committed dependency lock retain `brace-expansion 5.0.12`. A fresh isolated `npm ci --ignore-scripts` installed that version from the official SDK; regenerating the lockfile with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts` retained it. Both existing dependency security checks passed. The SDK API version is unchanged, and the `vendor` archive, metadata, and repackaging script have been removed.

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm ls brace-expansion --all
npm run build
npm run test:contracts
npm audit --json
```

Docker and CI use the same committed lockfile with `npm ci`; no generated SDK archive or install-time patch is needed. When updating dependencies, check the installed version and run the security regression checks again. The earlier archive's provenance remains available in the [0.1.4 source](https://github.com/buYoung/pi-codex-auto-review/blob/v0.1.4/vendor/pi-sdk-security.json).

## Recorded results

- Before the fix, valid signatures passed, but a malformed signature was accepted as `true`. Brace expansion input was stopped by a five-second limit.
- After the fix, valid signatures still passed and the malformed signature was rejected. The same brace input completed within the limit.
- Fifty-eight local checks covering contracts, Pi integration, native isolation, and package execution passed. Full platform aggregation and live model revalidation were deferred to the final source incorporating later feature changes.

This adjustment applies to environments installed with this repository's lockfile. It does not automatically change dependencies in separately installed Pi hosts or other projects. In other environments, inspect the dependencies actually resolved and that environment's audit results separately.

## Current npm distribution

An installed dependency's `overrides` do not apply to the consumer project, and `package-lock.json` is not published. The sandbox runtime bundled in the earlier package has been removed from the current source. Prepack checks ensure that sandbox code and `node_modules` are absent from the archive.

The Pi host remains in `peerDependencies` and is not bundled. `@buyong/redact` is a regular `dependencies` entry, not a bundled one; the archive contains only a reference to it. This repository's development lockfile does not change or guarantee the `brace-expansion` version of a separately installed Pi.

Run `npm pack` from the repository root to apply prepack checks. The current source builds and packages JavaScript without a Rust compiler or platform executable. Consumer installation needs no security patch script. See the [publishing guide](../publishing.md).
